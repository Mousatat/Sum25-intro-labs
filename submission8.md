# SRE Lab - Submission

## Overview
This lab explores Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles through:
- **System Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and I/O usage analysis
- **Disk Space Management**: Storage monitoring and optimization
- **Website Monitoring**: Real-time availability and performance monitoring
- **SLA/SLI Implementation**: Service level indicators and objectives

## Task 1: Key Metrics for SRE and SLAs

### Objective
Monitor system resources and manage disk space to understand core SRE metrics.

### System Resource Monitoring

#### CPU, Memory, and I/O Usage Analysis
Using system monitoring tools to identify resource consumption patterns:

```bash
# Monitor system resources
htop
iostat -x 1 3
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10
```

#### Top 3 Most Consuming Applications

**CPU Usage:**
```
Top 3 CPU-consuming processes:
1. chrome.exe         - 9170.48 CPU units (Web browser)
2. chrome.exe         - 7945.92 CPU units (Web browser process)
3. steamwebhelper.exe - 4182.61 CPU units (Steam client helper)

System CPU Load: 89%
Total Physical Memory: 12,790,325,248 bytes (~12 GB)
```

**Memory Usage:**
```
Top 3 memory-consuming processes:
1. chrome.exe    - 455,069,696 bytes (~434 MB) - Web browser
2. chrome.exe    - 446,042,112 bytes (~425 MB) - Web browser process

Working Set Memory consumption shows heavy usage by:
- Web browsers (Chrome with multiple processes)
- System security (MsMpEng - Windows Defender)
```

**I/O Usage:**
```
Disk Space Analysis:
Drive C: - 214,695,931,904 bytes total (~200 GB)
        - 1,208,111,104 bytes free (~1.1 GB)
        - Usage: 99.4% (Critical - Low disk space)

Drive D: - 157,810,683,904 bytes total (~147 GB)
        - 25,074,102,272 bytes free (~23.3 GB)
        - Usage: 84.1%

Drive E: - 157,286,395,904 bytes total (~146 GB)
        - 26,018,021,376 bytes free (~24.2 GB)
        - Usage: 83.5%
```

### Disk Space Management

#### Disk Usage Analysis
```bash
# Check overall disk space
df -h

# Analyze directory sizes
du -sh /var/* | sort -hr | head -10

# Find largest files in /var
find /var -type f -exec ls -la {} \; 2>/dev/null | sort -k5 -nr | head -10
```

#### Top 3 Largest Files in Windows System32 Directory
```
Note: Windows doesn't have a /var directory, so analyzing Windows\System32 as equivalent system directory

Top 3 largest files in C:\Windows\System32:
1. MRT.exe - 216,824,056 bytes (~207 MB) - Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool
2. RCORES64.dat - 72,529,416 bytes (~69 MB) - Realtek Audio Cores data file
3. Various DLL files including:
   - igd11dxva64.dll - Graphics driver component
   - WindowsCodecs.dll - Windows Imaging Component
   - edgehtml.dll - Microsoft Edge HTML engine

Analysis shows system files consuming significant disk space:
- Security tools (MRT.exe) taking largest space
- Audio drivers and codecs
- Graphics and web rendering components
```

### SRE Metrics Analysis

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Availability**: System uptime percentage
- **Latency**: Response time metrics
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Error Rate**: Failed requests percentage

#### Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

## Task 2: Practical Website Monitoring Setup

### Objective
Set up real-time monitoring for a website using Checkly to demonstrate SRE monitoring principles.

### Website Selection
**Target Website**: `https://github.com`
**Reasoning**: Chosen for its:
- High availability and reliability
- Public accessibility
- Rich content for testing interactions
- Critical importance for developers (good SRE monitoring example)
- Multiple elements to validate (navigation, search, user interactions)

### Checkly Setup Process

#### Step 1: Account Creation
1. Sign up at [Checkly](https://checklyhq.com/) (free account)
2. Verify email and complete onboarding

#### Step 2: API Check Configuration
**Basic Availability Monitoring**

```yaml
Check Type: API Check
URL: https://github.com
Method: GET
Assertion: Status code equals 200
Headers: User-Agent: "Checkly-Monitor/1.0"
Frequency: Every 5 minutes
Locations: Multiple regions (US-East, EU-West, Asia-Pacific)
```

**Configuration Details:**
- **Name**: "GitHub Availability Check"
- **URL**: https://github.com
- **Expected Status**: 200 OK
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Retry Policy**: 2 retries with 5-second intervals
- **Additional Assertions**:
  - Response time < 2000ms
  - Response body contains "GitHub"

#### Step 3: Browser Check Configuration
**Content and Interaction Monitoring**

```yaml
Check Type: Browser Check
URL: https://github.com
Script: 
  - Navigate to GitHub homepage
  - Verify title contains "GitHub"
  - Check for search box presence
  - Test navigation elements
  - Measure page load performance
Frequency: Every 10 minutes
Locations: US-East, EU-West
```

**Browser Check Script:**
```javascript
// Navigate to GitHub homepage
await page.goto('https://github.com');

// Basic content validation
const title = await page.title();
expect(title).toContain('GitHub');

// Element presence checks
const searchBox = await page.$('input[placeholder*="Search"]');
expect(searchBox).toBeTruthy();

const navigation = await page.$('nav[role="navigation"]');
expect(navigation).toBeTruthy();

// Check for sign-in button
const signInButton = await page.$('a[href="/login"]');
expect(signInButton).toBeTruthy();

// Performance measurement
const loadTime = await page.evaluate(() => {
  return performance.timing.loadEventEnd - performance.timing.navigationStart;
});
expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(3000);

// Interaction test - click search box
await searchBox.click();
await page.waitForTimeout(1000);

// Verify page responsiveness
const responseTime = await page.evaluate(() => {
  return performance.now();
});
expect(responseTime).toBeLessThan(5000);
```

#### Step 4: Alert Configuration

**Alert Rules Setup:**
- **Trigger**: 2 consecutive failed checks
- **Notification Methods**: Email, Slack (or preferred)
- **Escalation**: SMS for critical failures
- **Recovery Notification**: Yes

**Alert Thresholds:**
- **Availability**: < 99.9% uptime
- **Response Time**: > 3 seconds
- **Error Rate**: > 1% of requests
