## Task 1: First GitHub Actions Pipeline

### Following the Official Quickstart Guide

I followed the [GitHub Actions quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) to create my first CI/CD pipeline. Here are the key steps I implemented:

#### Steps Followed:

1. **Created `.github/workflows` Directory Structure**
   - Created the required directory structure: `.github/workflows/`
   - This is where GitHub automatically looks for workflow files

2. **Created Workflow File**
   - File: `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`
   - Used YAML format as required by GitHub Actions
   - Named the workflow "CI/CD Pipeline" for clarity

3. **Configured Basic Triggers**
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ "main", "master" ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ "main", "master" ]
   ```

4. **Defined Jobs and Steps**
   - Created `build-and-test` job running on `ubuntu-latest`
   - Added steps for checkout, setup, greeting, testing, and building
   - Used official actions like `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-node@v4`

#### Key Observations from Quickstart Guide:

- **Workflows** are defined in YAML files and stored in `.github/workflows/`
- **Events** trigger workflows (push, pull_request, etc.)
- **Jobs** run in parallel by default unless dependencies are specified
- **Steps** are individual tasks within a job
- **Actions** are reusable units of code (marketplace or custom)
- **Runners** are servers that execute workflows (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted)

### Initial Workflow Structure

The basic workflow includes:
- **Checkout Action**: Downloads repository content to the runner
- **Environment Setup**: Configures Node.js runtime
- **Basic Commands**: Displays messages and simulates testing/building
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Uses ubuntu-latest runner

## Task 2: Manual Triggering and System Information

### Manual Trigger Implementation

#### Changes Made to Enable Manual Triggering:

1. **Added `workflow_dispatch` Trigger**
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ "main", "master" ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ "main", "master" ]
     # Manual trigger added here
     workflow_dispatch:
   ```

2. **Benefits of Manual Triggering:**
   - Allows on-demand workflow execution
   - Useful for deployment workflows
   - Enables testing without code changes
   - Provides control over when workflows run

#### Manual Trigger Documentation:
- Accessed via GitHub UI: Repository → Actions → Select Workflow → "Run workflow"
- No additional inputs configured as per lab requirements
- Can be triggered from any branch
- Maintains same workflow logic as automated triggers

### System Information Gathering

#### Added Dedicated `system-info` Job:

The system information gathering includes multiple categories:

1. **Runner Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   echo "Runner OS: $RUNNER_OS"
   echo "Runner Architecture: $RUNNER_ARCH"
   echo "Runner Name: $RUNNER_NAME"
   echo "Runner Tool Cache: $RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE"
   ```

2. **Hardware Specifications**
   ```bash
   cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name" | head -1
   echo "CPU Cores: $(nproc)"
   free -h  # Memory information
   df -h    # Disk space information
   ```

3. **Operating System Details**
   ```bash
   cat /etc/os-release  # OS distribution info
   uname -a            # Kernel information
   ```

4. **Available Tools and Versions**
   ```bash
   git --version
   node --version
   npm --version
   python3 --version
   docker --version
   ```

5. **GitHub Actions Context**
   ```yaml
   echo "GitHub Event: ${{ github.event_name }}"
   echo "GitHub Repository: ${{ github.repository }}"
   echo "GitHub Actor: ${{ github.actor }}"
   echo "GitHub SHA: ${{ github.sha }}"
   ```

## Key Concepts and Observations

### GitHub Actions Core Concepts:

1. **Workflow Architecture**
   - Workflows contain jobs, jobs contain steps
   - Jobs run in parallel unless `needs` dependency is specified
   - Each job runs in a fresh virtual environment

2. **Event-Driven Automation**
   - Multiple trigger types: push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch, schedule, etc.
   - Conditional execution based on paths, branches, or custom conditions
   - Context information available via `${{ github.* }}` expressions

3. **Action Marketplace**
   - Pre-built actions available from GitHub Marketplace
   - Community-contributed and GitHub-official actions
   - Versioning with tags (e.g., `@v4`) for stability

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Secrets management for sensitive data
   - Permission scopes and GITHUB_TOKEN
   - Environment protection rules

### Advanced Features Implemented:

1. **Job Dependencies**
   ```yaml
   system-info:
     needs: build-and-test
   ```

2. **Multi-Job Workflow**
   - `build-and-test`: Core CI functionality
   - `system-info`: Infrastructure information gathering
   - `code-quality`: Additional validation checks

3. **Environment Context Usage**
   - Leveraged built-in environment variables
   - Used GitHub context objects for metadata
   - Demonstrated runner environment exploration

## Workflow Execution Results

### Expected Workflow Behavior:

When the workflow executes, it will:

1. **Trigger Events**
   - Automatically on push to main/master branches
   - Automatically on pull requests to main/master branches
   - Manually via GitHub Actions UI

2. **Job Execution Order**
   - `build-and-test` and `code-quality` run in parallel
   - `system-info` waits for `build-and-test` to complete (due to `needs` dependency)

3. **Output Sections**
   - Build and test confirmation messages
   - Comprehensive system information
   - File structure validation
   - Markdown file validation

### Simulated Execution Output:

```
✅ Build and Test Job:
- Repository checked out successfully
- Node.js 18 configured
- Greeting message displayed
- Tests passed simulation
- Build completed simulation

✅ System Info Job:
- Runner environment details
- Hardware specifications (CPU, Memory, Disk)
- Operating system information
- Tool versions and availability
- GitHub Actions context data

✅ Code Quality Job:
- Project structure analysis
- Markdown file validation
- Repository metrics
```

## Additional CI/CD Features Implemented

### Code Quality Checks:
- **File Structure Analysis**: Scans repository structure
- **Markdown Validation**: Checks for empty markdown files
- **Repository Metrics**: File count and size analysis

### Best Practices Applied:
1. **Action Versioning**: Used specific version tags (@v4)
2. **Job Dependencies**: Proper sequencing with `needs`
3. **Descriptive Naming**: Clear job and step names
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed output for debugging
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing tools
